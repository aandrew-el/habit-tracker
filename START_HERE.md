# START HERE - Habit Tracker Setup

## What We Just Did Together:

✅ Created project folder: `C:\Users\andre\cursor-projects\habit-tracker`
✅ Initialized Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint
✅ Installed Supabase packages
✅ Created basic Supabase client (`lib/supabase.ts`)
✅ Created step-by-step Cursor prompts (`CURSOR_PROMPTS.md`)
